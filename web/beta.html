Welcome to disParity 0.26 Beta
</font>
<p>
<font size="+1">
About the new version
</font>
<p>
The new version of disParity is a near-total rewrite of the old utility.  It now features a full Windows-based UI.  It is no longer necessary to edit your configuration by hand or type any commands on the command line to keep your backup up to date.  You can leave disParity running on your system and update your parity backup with a single button press.
<p>
<i>Note: command line support is currently disabled in the beta, but will return soon. </i>
<p>

Bugs
</font>
<p>
I've tried really hard to make the new version as reliable and easy to use as possible.  However, this is still early beta software.  Bugs are expected to occur.  Your feedback and bug reports will help stabilize it and get it ready for a wider audience.  If you encounter any problems with the beta, please report them in <a href="http://www.vilett.com/disParity/forum/forum.php?id=3">the forum</a>.  If you need a forum account, please <a href="mailto:rolandv@gmail.com">send me an email.</a> 
<p>
Also, I know it's natural to start thinking about new features when a new version comes out, but right now is not a good time to request them.  The goal is to stabilize this beta as it is so it can be released.  Once released, then we can start talking about new features!

Requirements
</font>
<p>
The only requirements for running the disParity beta are Windows XP or later and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=17851">.NET Framework 4.0</a> (note this has changed from previous versions which required .NET 2.0).  The installer should detect if you do not have .NET 4.0 installed and take you to the download page automatically.

Download
</font>

<p>

Upgrading to the beta
</font>
<p>
If you are a new user, simply install and launch disParity.  Follow the instructions in the UI for setting up a new backup configuration. 
<p>
For existing disParity users, the new UI version of disParity is backwards compatible with previous versions, except for the configuration file, so you should be able to upgrade to the beta without having to rebuild your backup.  The new configuration file is no longer meant to be edited by hand.  Migrating your configuration over requires the following steps to be performed one time only:
<p>
1. Install disParity and launch it from the desktop shortcut.
<br>2. Accept the license agreement.
<br>3. After the main window comes up, press the "Options..."" button.
<br>4. In the Options dialog, press the "Import..." button.
<br>5. Select the location of your old config.txt file and press OK.
<br>6. Your old configuration will be converted to the new format and saved in disParity's application data folder (typically under C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\disParity).  The old config.txt file will not be modified.
