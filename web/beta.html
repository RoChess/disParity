Feedback of any kind on the beta, positive or negative, is welcome.  If you don't want to post in the forum, you can

Upgrading from the old command line version
</font>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> the old command line version of disParity has known bugs that in some cases can lead to a corrupted backup.
All users of the old command line version are <i>strongly</i> encouraged to upgrade to the new UI version.  After upgrading,
it is highly recommended that you run a Verify pass (press the "Verify" button in the main window.)
The Verify pass will check your parity data for errors and in most cases repair them automatically.
<p>
For users of the old command line version (versions 0.21 and earlier), the new UI version of disParity is backwards compatible with the old version, except for the configuration file, so you should be able to upgrade to the beta without having to rebuild your backup.  The new configuration file is no longer meant to be edited by hand.  Migrating your configuration over requires the following steps to be performed one time only:
<p>
1. Install disParity and launch it from the desktop shortcut.
<br>2. Accept the license agreement.
<br>3. After the main window comes up, press the "Options..."" button.
<br>4. In the Options dialog, press the "Import..." button.
<br>5. Select the location of your old config.txt file and press OK.
<br>6. Your old configuration will be converted to the new format and saved in disParity's application data folder (typically under C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\disParity).  The old config.txt file will not be modified.
