Before release:

* Process of setting up new array should be smooth

* About dialog (w/ copyright, etc.)

* Upgrade check on startup

* Schedule automatic updates

* License agreement!


Other stuff:

* Long running operations (update, cancel, etc.) should be cancellable w/o
  corrupting anything.
  
* Recover should prompt first before overwriting an existing file

* Temporary storage should ALWAYS use tempRAM first and then overflow to disk
  when necessary.

* Look for ways to speed up scans of Music drive

* test what happens when a file is removed that doesn't overlap with any 
  other files (e.g. towards the end of the largest drive.)  Make sure all zeros
  are written to parity in this case.

* update scan should handle case where file attributes only have changed -
  no parity change occurs but the updated attributes should be saved to the meta data
* thread safety
