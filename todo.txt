Before release:

* Process of setting up new array should be smooth

* Recover should continue even if errors are encountered; if there are errors,
  there should be a window listing all of them.
  
* Options dialog 




* test what happens when a file is removed that doesn't overlap with any 
  other files (e.g. towards the end of the largest drive.)  Make sure all zeros
  are written to parity in this case.

* update scan should handle case where file attributes only have changed -
  no parity change occurs but the updated attributes should be saved to the meta data
* thread safety
