Roland Vilett's disParity

This is the public repository for the disParity project created by Roland Vilett.

The most up-to-date branch is "beta".  The "master" and "develop" branches are stale.

There is a branch off of beta called "beta-FileDB" which contains Roland's final contribution to the project.  Those changes are untested, but give an insight into the direction he was taking for the next beta.

This software is now unsupported outside of whatever help can be found in the forum.  This repo has been made public so that fans of disParity may have the opportunity to improve upon it, and as a tribute to the great developer that Roland was.

Contact the project owner on GitHub if you would like to be a disParity contributor.
