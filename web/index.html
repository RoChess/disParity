Welcome to disParity
</font>
<br><br>
<p align=left>
DisParity is a free backup utility that calculates
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit#RAID">parity</a> from
data on multiple hard drives.  If one of the drives fails, disParity can use
the previously calculated parity data, in combination with the remaining drives,
to recover the contents of the lost drive.  It's a
fast, free and easy way to protect yourself against data loss caused by hard drive 
failures on home media servers.
<p>
The concept is similar to RAID, but no specialized hardware is required.  Unlike
traditional hardware RAID solutions, there is no limit on the number of drives
that can be protected, and no requirement that all drives be the same size, or
even on the same PC.  The approach used by disParity is sometimes 
referred to as "software RAID" or
"snapshot RAID", because the utility operates on a fixed snapshot of the hard 
drive data taken at a particular time.  Because of this, it is not suitable for use
on drives where files are changing frequently, such as database servers.  It
is perfect, however, for applications such as multi-terabyte home media servers,
where files change infrequently.
<p>
Once the initial parity snapshot has been created, disParity can quickly 
update the snapshot to reflect changes made to the data, such as the addition
of new files, removal of old files, etc.
<p>
The only requirements for running disParity are Windows and 
the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=17851">.NET Framework 2.0</a>.
<p>
The command line version of disParity is well tested and stable.  It can be downloaded <a href="./disParity0.21.zip">here</a>.  The
download includes a readme with instructions.  Support for disParity is provided via the <a href="./forum/">forum</a>.
<p>
<i>Update December 6, 2012</i>:
<p>
There is now a new UI version of disParity.  It is still in early beta testing.  If you are comfortable running beta software and reporting bugs, please see the <a href="beta.html">beta page</a>.
