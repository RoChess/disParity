Release notes for disParity beta 
</font>
<p>
<i>Changes in version 0.32 beta released Friday, December 28, 2012</i>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Fixed bug that could cause Verify to incorrectly report errors.
<li>Verify will now attempt to automatically repair any bad blocks it finds.
<li>Increased default value for Max Temp RAM from 512K to 1,024K 
</ul>
<p>
<i>Changes in version 0.31 beta released Wednesday, December 26, 2012</i>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Fixed two more parity corruption bugs, one of which has actually been around for years and even affects the command line version.  Again, run Verify to see if you have been affected.</li>
<li>Fixed "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" error when recovering a drive.</li>
<li>"Edits" are no longer tracked separately from adds and deletes.  This was causing too many issues (e.g. edited files would appear twice in the Undelete dialog.)  Any edited file will appear after a scan as 1 deleted file and 1 added file, since they are processed during an update first by removing the old file and then adding the new file.</li>  
</ul>
<p>
<i>Changes in version 0.30 beta released Tuesday, December 25, 2012</i>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Fixed a parity corruption bug introduced in version 0.29.  The bug affected Updates done where files smaller than the "Max Temp RAM" setting were added or removed.  To see if you were affected by this bug, press the Verify button.  If Verify reports errors (it may take a while), you should rebuild your backup.  To rebuild your backup:
<ol>
<li>Exit disParity.
<li>Go to your parity drive and delete "files*.dat" and "parity*.dat".
<li>Restart disParity.
<li>Press the Update button.
</ol>
</li>
<li>The drive panel right-click menu now has a "undelete" option.  This will restore any files that have been edited or deleted since the last update.  You can choose which files to restore in the dialog that comes up.</li>
<li>Better handling for files and folders with names longer than 260 characters (a hard limit imposed by .NET).  The files won't be backed up but they shouldn't cause any other problems. 
</ul>
<p>
<i>Changes in version 0.29 beta released Wednesday, December 19, 2012</i>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Moved drive-specific commands (Scan, Recover, etc.) out of the main button panel and into a right-click menu on the drive panel.</li>
<li>Added support for file hash checking.  "Hashcheck" re-computes the hash value for every file on a drive  
and compares it against the saved hash.  Hashcheck errors indicate the possibility of corruption on a drive.  </li>  
<li>Added a Verify button.  Verify exhaustively re-computes every parity block and compares it with the on-disk parity.  Verify errors indicate 
the possibility of either file corruption or (more likely) a bug in disParity. </li>  
<li>The time to flush temp parity is now included in the per-file progress bar during Update.</li>
<li>Temp RAM is now used for ALL files during an update; files that are larger than temp RAM fall back to the on-disk temp file when temp RAM is full.  This significantly improves Update times for large files.</li>  
<li>System memory load is now monitored during updates to make sure that high values for the "Max Temp RAM" setting won't severely impact the 
system.  If memory load gets too high, disParity now switches to the on-disk temp file 
immediately (rather than waiting to reach Max Temp RAM first.)  This greatly reduces the risk of destabilizing your system by setting the "Max Temp RAM" option too high.</li>   
<li>Attempts to add the same drive more than once (or different paths on the same drive) are detected and warned against.  Ignore this warning at your own risk!  disParity will not be able to recover any data from a lost drive if that drive appears more than once in the array (either as data or as parity.)</li>
<li>Buttons on the main button panel now have tooltips.</li>
<li>File moves and renames (which are time-consuming to detect since files must be hashed) are now processed as part of the Scan phase rather than the Update phase.</li>
<li>Disk space used and free for the parity drive are now displayed in main window.</li>
<li>General log file and error handling improvements.</li>
</ul>
